# Minimart case:

# A marketing research would like to compare the average of purchasing bill by two minimart chains â€“ Spar and Hema.
# The purchasing bill of each minimart chain is provided as the following:
# Spar: 54, 48, 39, 99, 48, 71, 82, 37, 63, 43
# Hema: 67, 23, 50, 79, 45, 55
# The researcher believe that the purchasing bill of both minimart are not different. Test the hypothesis at 10% significance level
